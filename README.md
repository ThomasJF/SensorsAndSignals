A system with signals and infrared sensors for Rocrail

This ist the Arduino ESP8266 code for small board (25x40mm) that connects 2 infrared sensors, a signal with 3 or 4 LEDs and a serial port for an MP3 player. It is powerd by DC or AC between 10 and 20V. The onboard Powersupply can also drive the signal and the MP3 Player.
The board connects via WiFi to a Raspberry Pi 3, that acts as as concentrator / router for many of these boards.
The Raspberry connects to Rocrail via Ethernet using RocNet.
Most of the parameters can be changed via browser. 
The Board can be ordered from SeeedStudio (public domain). For soldering it is recommended to order a sencil with the board.
Drawings and BOM can be published if requested.
