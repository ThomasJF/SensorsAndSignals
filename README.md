A system with signals and infrared sensors f√∂r RocRail

This ist the Arduino ESP8266 code for small board (25x35mm) that connects 2 infrared sensors, a signal with 3 or 4 LEDs and a serial port for an MP3 player. 
The board connects via WiFi to a Raspberry Pi 3, that acts as as concentrator / router for many of these boards.
The Raspberry connects to RocRail via Ethernet using RocNet.
The Board can be ordered from SeeedStudio (public domain). For soldering it is recommended to order a sencil with the board.
